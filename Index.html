        <h3>Welcome to my personal website! This is the home page,
            which is the gateway to three web pages that I have created.
            These pages have information about networks, hardware, and software.<br><br><br>


            This page covers a topic related to network connectivity,
            ranging from local area networks (LANs) to wide area networks (WANs).
            It explains about networksand all the basics.<br><br><br>
            
            Another page on my website is dedicated to hardware. From CPUs to GPUs,
            RAM to storage, I've covered it all. I've also included some information
            on all types of hardware and gave information about each.<br><br><br>
            
            
            Last but not least (on the same page), I have the Softwares. Here I
            have included facts about software, including operating systems and
            applications. I have covered different types of software explained
            them briefly.</h3>
